Basic usage:
Run src/deobfuscate_tests.py in interpreter.
run the function deobfuscate(s) on a string s to see how the 
algorithm decodes it.

The HMM is cached in the pickled_* files in the data/ directory.
If you want to mess with the training data files/ dictionary /
word_frequency corpus.  Make sure to run the src/reset_learning script
to clear these cached files.  The program will use the HMM stored here
if these files exist.
