Basic usage:
Run src/deobfuscate_tests.py in interpreter.
run the function deobfuscate(s) on a string s to see how the 
algorithm decodes it.

The HMM is cached in the pickled_* files in the data/ directory.
If you want to mess with the training data files/ dictionary /
word_frequency corpus.  Make sure to run the src/reset_learning script
to clear these cached files.  The program will use the HMM stored here
if these files exist.

Sorry the code if poorly commented and overall kind of hacked
together.. had lots of things to fix and little time.

File Descriptions:
JCullenProjectReport.pdf is my project report
OriginalPaper.pdf is the paper the project is based on
data/words.txt - the dictionary of words used
data/training_data.txt - obfuscated training data
data/training_outputs.txt - manually cleaned up training data
data/freq_corpus.txt - email corpus used for english word frequencies
data/pickled_* - cached versions of data structues used to save time
src/hmm.py - crappy implementation of a hmm I tried to use but
             abandoned because it was too slow..
src/deobfuscate.py -  main source file
src/deobfuscate_tests.py - tests
src/reset_learnin - bash script to remove cached data structures
